// Pieces to be uncommented as they become developed with proper code
 
 Lat/Long Formatter(s){
 Specify no more than two digits on either side of a decimal place, and either N/S or E/W (depending on whether lat or lon is being checked)
 }
 
 Street Formatter{
 No punctuation, possibly check for name and street type, but with name potentially being more than 1 word, may prove difficult to implement
 }
 
 //These shall be custom formatters, which inherit from the abstract class formatter.
