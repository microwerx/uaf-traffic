# UAF Traffic User Manual


## Getting Started

![example image](godzilla.png)

When preparing to record data for an intersection or stretch of road, you should first ensure that the *iPad* or other *iOS* device you will be using for recording purposes has sufficient power to remain charged for the expected duration of the vehicle counting session.  You should also ensure that the uaftraffic app is installed on the device (it should be a white icon with 6 purple and orange arrows coming out from the bottom of it, as depicted here ![icon](appstore.png "appIcon")).  Once at the intersection or stretch of road intended for study, turn on the device and tap on the uaftraffic app icon identified previously.

## Creating a New Session

Once you have tapped on the app, you should be at the main menu, depicted here.  Tap on the topmost button, labeled “Start a New Session.”  You should now see the Direction Select screen, depicted here.  The checkmarks next to the directions signify that those directions are present in the intersection or stretch of road being recorded.  Tapping on any of the directions will remove the checkmark, signifying that the direction in question is not present in the intersection or stretch of road being studied.  Tapping on a previously tapped direction will place the checkmark back on, in case a mistake was made in the initial tap.  It is not possible for fewer than two directions to be present in a site being studied, so no more than two directions can be removed from the studied site at any time.  Once the directions with checkmarks next to them accurately represent the site being studied, click the “Next” button at the top right of the screen to proceed.  The Vehicle Select page, shown here, should now appear on your device.  Tapping on the symbols depicted will place a checkmark next to them, symbolizing that the vehicle represented by that symbol is expected to be seen at the location being studied.  Tapping on a symbol with a checkmark next to it will remove the checkmark, in case the symbol was not intentionally tapped on.  No more than five symbols may have checkmarks next to them at any time.  Once the list of vehicles with checkmarks next to them is satisfactory, tap the “Next” button at the top right once more to proceed.  You will now be presented with a prompt to name your session, with a screen that appears as follows.  Tap on the letters on the keyboard to add them to the prompt box, and remove them again using the delete button, which appears as a house shape pointing left with an x in the middle of it.  Once the name of the session (preferably something related to the road or roads being observed) is entered correctly, tap either the “return” button on the keyboard or the “Save” button at the bottom of the box which requested the session name.  You will then be prompted to input the latitude of the session, using the same techniques used for the session's name.  This will be followed by Longitude, the road running east to west, the road running north to south, and, finally, your name.  Once all of this information has been entered, the screen will change.

## Collecting Data

You should now see a screen similar to the “Count Traffic” screen depicted here.  As you observe vehicles traversing the intersection or stretch of road, place your finger on the symbol representing the vehicle you witnessed, drag your finger across the screen to the direction it went, and remove your finger from the screen to register the transition.  If the transition was registered correctly, the vehicle symbol will shrink down before reappearing at its point of origin.  If the transition was not registered correctly, the vehicle symbol will instead slide across the screen back to its point of origin.  If a crossing which did not occur is registered, press the “Undo” button in the top right corner of the screen to remove the crossing from the list of registered crossings.  Once you have completed the session, press the “End Session” button in the top left corner of the screen to return to the main menu.

## Resuming a Prior Session

If a session is incomplete, you can access it again by tapping on the “Resume a Previous Session” button, the second button from the top, to access the “Resume Session” screen.  From the “Resume Session” screen, shown here, tap on a session name to access the “Count Traffic” screen for that session, at which point you can track crossings in it in the same manner as was done previously.  Tap the “Close” button at the top left of the screen to return to the main menu instead.

## Managing Past Sessions

Now that the session has been saved, you can access its data by tapping the “Manage Past Sessions” button, the third one down.  On the “Manage Sessions” screen, shown here, you can tap on a session name to access its data (data interface shown here), the delete button if the session should need to be deleted, or the upload button to sync the data with the collection website.  To return to the “Manage Sessions” screen from the session data screen tap on the “Manage Sessions” button at the top left of the session data screen.  To return to the main menu, tap the “Close” button at the top left of the “Manage Sessions” screen.

## Exporting Data

The primary data collector should have given you a PIN code to enter in order to upload your data.  To enter the PIN, tap on the grey “1234” located at the top of the screen, then tap the numbers on the keyboard, in a similar manner to when the session name was determined.  Upon entering four digits, the PIN will automatically enter itself, and either start to upload the data if the PIN was correct, or to clear the PIN code, allowing for re-entry of a code, and provide you with an error message (shown here).  Tap the “Cancel” button at the top left corner of your screen to return to the “Manage Sessions” screen.
